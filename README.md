# Capstone-Project---Drone-Image-Analysis
EDP Capstone Project Image Analysis with OpenCV

The skeleton of the algorithm has been made, along with the methods and variable types that will need to be called with OpenCV. The most efficient data types, methods, and best practices were researched beforehand, so that the algorithm is as fast as possible when it is finished.
